<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Most of the time in college we have faced the problem of not getting proper information regarding a query related to faculties(ffcs), exams, events, etc. 
Moreover nowadays, since there are strict anti ragging policies in place, seniors have limited their interaction with juniors. This affects the juniors negatively as they find themselves unable to receive any proper guidance.
In addition, during covid times, when everything is being done online, the problem has only increased where there has been little to no interaction between seniors and juniors or even among same year students. Students have not been able to get a proper college-like environment which is affecting their studies, health and enthusiasm.

To cut off these hindrances, we have decided to build a platform which will address the problem of limited interaction between college students. This platform will enable the students to choose their college and put up a query regarding any college related topic. This query will then be answered by the other students through the platform. The users would also be able to connect with each other through the platform. They would be able to send private messages to each other and review and upvote the answers to various queries as quality measure of the answers.

Getting an online platform will let students get appropriate information promptly regarding any topic/query and thereby, they will also be able to help others by answering their queries. This will also establish a community relationship between the students. Since this platform will be college centric, the environment on this platform will be more personalized to the college and it will only contain the information of the specific college.
